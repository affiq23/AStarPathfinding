# AStarPathfinding
A Star Pathfinding algorithm with interactive GUI
The GUI has a Map Generator button that randomly assigns each block an empty or full space. 
The Clear Map button clears all of these spaces to default empty. 
The Toolbox drop down menu has options to assign a Start and Finish block for the A Star Pathfinding algorithm to solve. It also has a Wall and Erase option
to individually clear or fill spaces.
The Size, Delay, and Density sliders allow the dimensions of the grid to be altered.
